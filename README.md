# Machine Learning Projects

This repository showcases various machine learning projects created as part of my freeCodeCamp course. Below is a list of the projects included.

## 1. Health Costs Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to predict health costs based on features such as age, BMI, and region using a linear regression model. The provided Jupyter Notebook (`health-costs-prediction-using-linear-regression.ipynb`) walks through the process of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Explore the notebook to see how the model is built and tested.
